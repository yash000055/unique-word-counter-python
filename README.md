# Unique Word Counter in Python

## Description :
This project is a Python program that processes a paragraph of text to identify unique words and analyze word occurrences. It demonstrates basic text processing using Python string methods, lists, and loops.

## What the Program Does :
- Takes a paragraph as input.
- Splits the paragraph into individual words.
- Identifies words that appear only once in the paragraph.
- Counts the total number of unique words.
- Calculates how many times each word appears.

## Logic Used :
- String splitting using `split()`
- List operations
- Looping through words
- Using the `count()` method to find occurrences

## Output :
- List of words that occur only once
- Count of unique words
- Occurrence count of each word in the paragraph

## Technologies Used :
- Python

## Use Cases :
- Text analysis
- Learning basic Natural Language Processing concepts
- Understanding loops and list operations in Python
- Beginner-friendly logic building project
